Software Engineering course project (2025/26). 

User stories:

1) As a student, I want to sell and buy lecture notes using platform’s internal coins, which I earn by
selling my own notes, and search for notes using a search bar, so that I can reduce the workload and
recover missed lectures

2) As a teacher, I want to create invitation-code-only folders to share my lecture notes and slides with my
students, so that I can support students who can’t attend all the lectures

3) As a power user, I want to receive reports on suspicious, overpriced or empty notes and to delete them
after review, so that I can ensure safe transactions and quality content

the note’s name and the earned credits.
